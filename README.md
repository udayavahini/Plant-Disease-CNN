# Plant & Urban Tree Disease Detection with CNN

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify diseases in plant leaves and urban trees from images. 
It covers data preprocessing, model design, and a user-facing interface. 

## Structure
- `src/`: Source code (data loaders, models)
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration/training
- `app/`: Streamlit app for interactive demos
